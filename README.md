## Let's get started

Hello, my name is Justin.
Currrently I am working on this portfolio-page.
It's made to represent my persona and my improvement as a developper.

progress. 

If you keep yourself up to date and come here from time to time,
you will see some things change. That should be normal in the near future.
Below you can see some things that I still wanna work on.
